 "content":"There are books providing coaching on various contest problems, but they aren't accessible to everyone because they are written in Russian or Chinese, according to Steven Halim, coach of the National University of Singapore team and author of 'Competitive Programming,' a book on the various types of problems found in the World Finals. 'I purposely wrote this book for everyone else,' Halim said of his decision to publish a book in English. The book covers problems contained in 40 percent of the ACM problem archive (edit: the new URL for ACM problem archive is: UVa online judge) Halim said. It contains problem descriptions, suggested algorithms for solving the problem with explanations, sample implementations and a list of examples implementations. The book is for sale at lulu.com",
