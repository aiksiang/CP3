'I purposely wrote this book for everyone else,' Halim said of his decision to publish a book in English. The book covers problems contained in 40 percent of the ACM problem archive (edit: the new URL for ACM problem archive is: UVa online judge) Halim said. It contains problem descriptions, suggested algorithms for solving the problem with explanations, sample implementations and a list of examples implementations. The book is for sale at lulu.com",
