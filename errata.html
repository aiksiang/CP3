	<h3>Errata (3rd Edition)</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>The first edition of this book was released on 9 August 2010.</li>
		<li>The second edition of this book was released on 1 August 2011 (1 year gap).</li>
		<li>The third edition of this book was released on 24 May 2013 (2 years gap).</li>
		<li>The fourth edition of this book is NOT YET planned, but you can expect an exponential gap, i.e. 4 years after 2013.</li>
		<li>As of Thursday, 13 Feb 2014, these are the known errata (yellow highlight => already fixed in Steven's soft copy):</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<h4>Bugs fixes for the example codes</h4>
		<li>Page 127: memset(dfs_num, UNVISITED, sizeof dfs_num); was a legacy code. We have changed dfs_num from plain array to vi (vector of integers), therefore the initialization part should be written as dfs_num.assign(V, UNVISITED);</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<h4>Correction to typos/grammatical/stylistic errors</h4>
		<li>Page 2, For very competitive programmer E: ... solve this 'well known' problem in â‰¤ 15 minutes...'.</li>
		<li>Page 6. Footnote 5. "This number may vary", not "This numbers may vary".</li>
		<li>Page 9, Question 4 should not have the word "randomly". The points are only randomly scattered in Question 8, not in Question 4.</li>
		<li>Page 10, Question 8, option (a). The complete search mentioned in question 4 (not question 3).</li>
		<li>Page 27. The answer for exercise 1.2.2, question 3. should be " (f) Fenwick Tree ... then (e) Segment Tree" (the reference letters are wrong).</li>
		<li>Page 28. The comment "Wed" written as the output for Exercise 1.2.3, task 3 is wrong. 9 August 2010 is "Mon".</li>
		<li>Page 28. The typedef pair<int, ii> iii in Exercise 1.2.3. task 5 is slightly wrong, it should be typedef pairt<ii, int> iii, because I use pair first (for Month and Day), and then one more integer for Year</li>
		<li>Page 29. The RegEx for Exercise 1.2.3 task 10 is not perfect as it may give extra spaces before and after the "***". The correct answer should be System.out.println(S.replaceAll("\\b[a-z][0-9][0-9]\\b", "***"));</li>
		<li>Page 141. Figure 4.13. The sentence "Edge 1-2 is fixed" is wrong. It should be "Edge 0-1" is fixed (off-by-one error).</li>
		<li>Page 204. Binet's formula is NOT an approximation formula. It is a closed form formula to compute Fib(n). It is imprecise due to floating point computation. It is also not an O(1) method, but O(log n) method as raising a number to the power of n requires O(log n) steps.</li>
		<li>Page 229. Exercise 5.4.4.2 answer. The "above" in "see above" refer to the fundamental counting principle mentioned in the answer of Exercise 5.4.4.1.</li>
		<li>Page 231. There is an extra "and" in "Postfix Calculator and (Infix to Postfix) Conversion and (Section 9.27)".</li>
		<li>Page 317. Section 9.2 about Bitonic TSP should be Section 9.3 (off-by-one error).</li>
